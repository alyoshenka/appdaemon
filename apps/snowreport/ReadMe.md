# Snow Report Application for HomeAssistant

The goal of this application is to be able to gather and parse snow report data and send it to a device at specified intervals.

Example app flow:
- Every morning at 6am
- Generate a snow report
- Send a notification if there is anything important in that report
- That links to a dashboard displaying the full report information
- Station-specific reports link to snotel page
- And also if this could be sent to multiple people that would be pretty cool
